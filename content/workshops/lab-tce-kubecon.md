Tanzu Community Edition enables the creation of modern application platforms. These platforms can be created on local laptops or various cloud and infrastructure options. A platform deployed using Tanzu Community Edition provides a Kubernetes runtime, tooling, and additional repository of packages that can be installed/updated very easily.

Tanzu Community Edition is freely available, community supported, and built on open source software components.

What you will do in the lab:
- Get familiar with Tanzu CLI
- Deploy modern apps
- Scale applications
- Monitor applications
